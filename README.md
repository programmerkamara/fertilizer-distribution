#step to run the project
1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Run the following command to clone the repository (replace REPOSITORY_URL with the actual URL of your GitHub repository):
sh
Copy code
git clone REPOSITORY_URL
For example:

git clone https://github.com/programmerkamara/fertilizer-distribution.git
2. Set Up the Django Backend
Navigate to the Backend Directory
Change to the directory containing the Django project. This might be the root of the repository or a subdirectory like backend or server.

Copy code
cd fertilizer-distribution  # Adjust this path as necessary
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages.

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Database
Run the database migrations to set up your database schema.




python manage.py migrate
Create a Superuser (Optional)
Create an admin user to access the Django admin interface.


python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the Django Development Server
Start the Django development server.


python manage.py runserver
Your Django backend should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

3. Set Up the React Frontend
Navigate to the Frontend Directory
Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the directory containing the React project. This might be the root of the repository or a subdirectory like frontend or client.


cd fertilizer-distribution/frontend  # Adjust this path as necessary
Install Dependencies
Install the required npm packages.

npm install
Start the React Development Server
Start the React development server.

npm start
Your React frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000/.

4. Configure the Backend-Frontend Connection
Adjust API Endpoints
Make sure your React app is configured to communicate with your Django backend. You may need to adjust API endpoints in your React app's configuration files or environment variables.

env

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
5. Verify the Setup
Open your browser and verify that both the frontend and backend are working:

React frontend: http://localhost:3000/
Django backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
